# JAM
JAM is a Job Application Manager meant to provide a hyperfocussed design for optimal job application management.

JAM is free open source software licensed under the GPL3 license. A copy of the license is provided in the LICENSE.txt file.

## Features provided by JAM:
Hyper focused UI for optimal job application management.<br/>
Simple image support for accurate record keeping (since links to job pages are unreliable).<br/>
A quick stats dialog for keeping a database of answers to commonly asked questions (ie what is your email).

## Security provided by JAM:
All files generated by JAM are stored locally on the users machine.<br/>
Since this data may include passwords or other sensative information, all data is encrypted using AES.<br/>
The key used for AES is also encrypted based on the current user to prevent decryption on other devices.<br/>
If the data is needed on another device, export and import options are provided in the settings dialog.

## Password recovery:
While no password is required to use JAM, it is reccomend that the user set a password in the settings dialog.<br/>
If the user forgets their password, a temporary password may be generated and sent to the email set in the settings dialog.<br/>
Due to JAM being free open source software, an emailing service is not provided, and the user will need to generate an app password for JAM to use.<br/>
Currently JAM only supports sending recovery emails through Gmail.
